I just finished reading over the project description again so that I can understand exactly what needs to be done. From what I understand so far, this project deals with storing information in a B-Tree and being able to perform various operations to access/modify that information. There also seem to be strict rules on the headers of the file and different nodes within the tree. I think that my initial plan to start this project is to watch a video to fully understand B-Trees more so I can understand how the different operations need to be performed. Then, I want to just get the project started by creating the template for each of the commands and maybe implementing the create command, based on how much time I have.
