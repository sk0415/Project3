I just finished reading over the project description again so that I can understand exactly what needs to be done. From what I understand so far, this project deals with storing information in a B-Tree and being able to perform various operations to access/modify that information. There also seem to be strict rules on the headers of the file and different nodes within the tree. I think that my initial plan to start this project is to watch a video to fully understand B-Trees more so I can understand how the different operations need to be performed. Then, I want to just get the project started by creating the template for each of the commands and maybe implementing the create command, based on how much time I have.

I was able to get the basic structure of the code set up yesterday, so just the "menu" and taking in the different command line arguments and then making placeholder functions. Now, I want to implement the create command properly. I think this will be a little tricky because I have to figure out how to properly implement the header logic. I think that once I figure out how to interact with the index file properly, the rest of the project should make a lot more sense. As of now, I understand that it's somewhat similar as writing to a csv file but I am writing bytes instead of just writing the input that I get. I'm not sure how to create different blocks of text and be able to read them in for later when I do the insert. But right now, I just want to do the creation of the file and set up the header.

I think I was able to properly create the file with the header as specified. I did this by creating a bytearray of size 512 and the modifying different parts of it to be what I wanted. I think that this is the technique that I'll end up using whenever I make blocks/nodes to go in the B Tree. I think the next command I want to somewhat figure out is insert, but I definitely think this will be the hardest. So essentially, I know that each node can have 19 key/value pairs and this is written in its 512 bytes. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I think the search function needs to be done first, so that I am not inserting duplicates. So with the search, I think I just have to look at the key of each node and then figure out if I need to go to the left or right.
